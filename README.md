# K-Means Clustering on Environmental Factors

## Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis and unsupervised learning using
K-Means clustering. The objective is to analyze environmental factors and group
similar data points based on feature patterns.

## Dataset
- Environmental factors structured dataset
- Multiple numerical features
- Cleaned and prepared for clustering analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA is performed to:
- Understand feature distributions
- Identify trends and patterns
- Analyze relationships between variables
- Detect outliers and inconsistencies

## Data Visualization
Visualizations used in this project:
- Histograms for feature distribution
- Scatter plots for feature relationships
- Box plots for outlier detection
- Cluster visualization plots

## Machine Learning Model
- K-Means Clustering
- Feature scaling
- Optimal cluster selection (Elbow method / Silhouette score)
- Cluster assignment and analysis

## Outcome
- Identification of meaningful clusters in environmental data
- Improved understanding of feature groupings
- Insights derived from unsupervised learning
